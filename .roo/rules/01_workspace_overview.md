# Workspace Overview

This repository implements **LifeOS**, a generic personal “operating system” framework.  
LifeOS is organized into eight core modules (A–H) plus two special modes:  
- **lifeos-onboarding** (a guided setup assistant)  
- **lifeos-orchestrator** (the single front-end agent for multi-module tasks)

Each module’s folder and file structure is defined under `Module_*/`.  
Use the appropriate mode—`lifeos-onboarding`, `lifeos-orchestrator`, or `module-A` through `module-H`—to interact with this workspace.
