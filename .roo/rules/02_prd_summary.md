# PRD Summary (Generic)

LifeOS is composed of:

- **Module A: Aspiration & Goal Command Center** – capture and review your ultimate vision, mission, and core values.  
- **Module B: Strategic Pathways** – map skill gaps, define experiences, and track “bridge projects.”  
- **Module C: Current Commitments & Value Extraction** – manage ongoing commitments (OKRs), track strategic value outputs, and link to bridge projects.  
- **Module D: Skill & Knowledge Acquisition Engine** – maintain a master learning list, scaffold Individual Learning Plans (ILPs), and schedule deliberate practice.  
- **Module E: Strategic Network & Relationships** – build a network map, manage CRM contacts, define engagement protocols, and set networking goals.  
- **Module F: Personal Resource Optimization Engine** – optimize time (calendar), energy (sleep/food/exercise), focus (cognitive load), and financial resources (budgeting).  
- **Module G: Performance Analytics & Review** – store Master KPIs, generate dashboards, run After Action Reviews (AARs), and schedule periodic reviews.  
- **Module H: System Learning & Adaptation** – track system bugs, feature requests, experiments, lessons learned, and maintain an OS changelog.  

The **LifeOS Orchestrator** mode coordinates cross-module workflows; the **Onboarding** mode scaffolds everything initially.
