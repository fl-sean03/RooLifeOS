# LifeOS Onboarding: Introduction

Welcome to LifeOS Onboarding!  
You are about to be guided through a series of questions that will help initialize your entire LifeOS workspace.  

**Your Role as Roo**:
- Explain to the user that you will ask questions in multiple sections to collect foundational information (vision, values, commitments, skills, network, resources, preferences).
- Confirm readiness before starting.
- After collecting all information, you will iteratively populate the pre-existing scaffolded files with the detailed data.

After this introduction, prompt the user:
> “Shall we begin? First, I’d like to ask about your personal vision and values.”
